# Incubator Hub - Data Analysis Project Capstone 1

### Project Topic - Palmoria Group HR Analysis

### Project Overview

Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company operating in 3 regions in Nigeria is recently embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality across its regions, and the fact that the media has escalated the matter in the public space is not looking good for a company that intends to expand its operation to other regions

This analysis intends to present the current employee status based on the HR data, give further insight, identify possible areas needing the attention of the management of Palmoria Group, and suggest necessary actions to be taken in order to nip this issue in the bud as soon as possible

### Data Sources

The primary data source is the “**Palmoria Group Emp-Data**” and the “**Palmoria Group Bonus-Data**” both, _**CSV file**_

### Tool Used

 -	Microsoft Power BI for Data collection/Uploading
 -	Microsoft Power BI Query for:

  	o	Data Cleaning
  	
  	o	Data Manipulation
  	
  	o	Data Munching
  	
  	o	Data Reporting

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

At the initial stage, the following actions were performed

-  Data loading and Inspection
-  Handling all missing values and replacing them with generic ones
-  Removal of the _"**Null**"_ value rolls
-  Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
    
The data were explored to get answers to some questions like:

 - 	What is the gender distribution across the organization – Distilled to regions and departments
 - 	HR performance rating based on gender
 - 	Gender pay gap in company's salary structure
 - 	If Palmoria Group meets the minimum payment requirement of $90,000 for manufacturing companies
 - 	The distribution of employees across different pay bands
 - 	Based on the new requirement, how many employees are below the minimum payment
 - 	Determining the bonus amount payable to each employee based on ratings
 - 	Total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive)
 - 	Total amount to be paid out per region and company wide
  
### Data Analysis - Insights/Recommendations

-	There’s a slight gender imbalance across the departments at Abuja as compared to Lagos and Kano regions, but this is not significant enough to affect the operation. However, the HR can address this in future recruitment
-	Cumulatively across the ratings, it is observed that the Female gender gets better performance ratings than the male. It means that more female might enjoy career growth and even get into management position faster than their male colleagues. This can further polarize the work environment in a company that is already battling with gender imbalance.
- On the other hand, it could also mean a skill gap or competency deficiency from the male counterparts which will require the HR department to organize   some form of on-the-Job trainings/seminars needed for better performance
- For the average salary, there’s no significant difference between both genders. It is still within reasonable amount. However, the average salary in certain departments like “**Supports**”, “**Product Management**”, “**Engineering**”, “**Sales**”, “**Legal**”, “**Human Resources**” and “**Research and Development**”, should be focused on, to maintain some balance
- As for the minimum industry payment of $90,000, **Palmoria Group** didn’t meet up, as over 70% of the employees are under this threshold. Out of the **946** employees, only **292** are above the threshold of $90,000. The remaining **654**(70%) employees are below $90,000
- Hence, the HR department and the management team need to address this as a matter of urgency to avoid sanctions from relevant regulatory bodies, as well as to show their level of compliance with the Industry approved standards.
- This can also aid and facilitate their ease of expansion into other regions
